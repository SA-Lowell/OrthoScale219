# Sources for OrthoScale219 Logo

This folder contains the raw SVG source files used to create the logo (ortho-scale-219-logo.svg) in the parent images/ folder.

## Files

- blender-camera.svg: A Blender camera in SVG form.
- blender-scale-gizmo.svg: Blender's scale gizmo in SVG form.

## Creation Process

- These files were created from screenshots (Blender Screenshot: included in each file) and edited + combined in Inkscape to form the final logo.
- If modifying, preserve original proportions and colors for consistency. Or don't, I guess. Do whatever.

See the root [README.md](../../../README.md) for logo usage in docs.

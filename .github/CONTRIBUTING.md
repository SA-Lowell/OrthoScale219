# Pull Requests

Pull requests are not currently accepted. However, if you submit one for testing or reference, use a specific PR template by appending `&template=bug-fix.md` (or `&template=code-change.md`, `&template=documentation.md`, `&template=security-fix.md`, etc.) to the PR creation URL.

**Note:** GitHub is an absolute mess. Sometimes you might have to use `?` instead of `&`. As long as you understand how URL's and url parameters work you'll understand which one to use... christ, who is in charge of GitHub's development?

Anyway, check out the [/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE) folder for all of the pull request templates.

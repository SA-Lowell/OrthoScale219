# Governance for OrthoScale219

## Project Overview

OrthoScale219 is a Blender add-on maintained by S.A. Lowell. As a solo-maintained project, all decisions, updates, and maintenance are handled by the maintainer.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Maintainer (S.A. Lowell)**: Sole decision-maker for features, bug fixes, releases, and code changes. Handles all code reviews, merges, and repository management.
- **Users/Community**: Can report bugs or suggest features via GitHub issues, but contributions (PRs) are not accepted. Forks are allowed under the license terms.

## Decision-Making Process

- Changes are made at the maintainer's discretion, based on project needs, user feedback from issues, and technical feasibility.
- Major updates (e.g., breaking changes) will be announced in CHANGELOG.md and releases.
- No voting or committeeâ€”decisions are final by the maintainer.

## Nomination and Changes to Governance

- No nominations needed, as this is a single-maintainer project.
- If governance changes (e.g., adding collaborators), this file will be updated. (It won't)
- **Nomination Criteria (Future-Proofing)**: Should the project open to collaborators, nominations would be based on demonstrated contributions (e.g., helpful issue reports, forks with improvements), technical expertise, and alignment with project goals. The maintainer would review and appoint based on need.
- **Change Process**: Proposals for governance updates (e.g., adding roles or processes) can be submitted via GitHub issues. The maintainer reviews and decides; changes are documented here and announced in releases.

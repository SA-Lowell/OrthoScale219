# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

OrthoScale219 supports security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.1.9   | :white_check_mark: (Current stable) |
| < 2.19  | :x:                |

Use the latest release for the most secure experience. Older versions may not receive updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in OrthoScale219, please report it privately to avoid public disclosure that could be exploited. But in all honesty, I don't see how this could ever have a security issue that's not embedded in Python or elsewhere that's beyond the scope of this add-on.

- **How to Report**: Contact me at [https://salowell.com/dev/Blender/OrthoScale219/] (include "Security Vulnerability" in the subject).
- **What to Include**: Describe the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any potential impact. Attach proof-of-concept code if safe.
- **Response Time**: Expect an acknowledgment once I'm able. I'll investigate and respond with next steps, such as a patch timeline.
- **Disclosure**: I follow responsible disclosure—once fixed, I'll credit you (if desired) in release notes and advise on public announcement.

Do not open public issues for security problems. For non-security bugs, use the repo's issues tab.

## Additional Notes

- This add-on is for non-commercial use primarily; commercial users with paid licenses get priority support for security fixes.
- I use tools like Dependabot for dependency scans—see workflows/ for details.

Thank you for helping keep OrthoScale219 secure!
